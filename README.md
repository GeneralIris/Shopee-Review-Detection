# Why no repo?
Well this is my final year project, currently just finished the machine learning + 3 models used for evaluating the best among them
## Ps~ Its SVM ;)

# Spam Detection System on Shopee Review
I hate current Shopee reviews. So I decide to make a detection spam system for it.

# What is this monstrosity!
It's a machine learning driven towards detecting spam reviews on any Shopee product.

# What is/are machine learning used?
Random Forest.

# Can I train them?
Yes, but only on CUDA supported devices. 
Python 3.9. Any thing above will get messy.
In terms of dependencies I really forgot to update them. But just install the packages in the notebook.

# To run the system?
You need to config a db on phpMyAdmin (I used) with all the stored proc I built.
*Not sure if I include them or not

# What's your machine specs?
Ryzen 5600X @ 4.4GHZ all core
ASUS TUF RTX3080
16GB 3600mhz
2 SSD and 3 HDDs (Project on SSD)

# Games I like ;0
